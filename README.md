## Project Summary

This project aims to analyze the sales performance of **four** distinct coffee beans types across **three** countries from **2019 to 2022**. The analysis will focus on identifying sales trends within each country, determining the overall top five customers, and observing changes over time. To facilitate deeper insights, the interactive dashboard will provide filtering options based on roast type, coffee order size (in kilograms), loyalty card usage, and customizable time frames.

## Executive Summary

This is a descriptive analysis, as the data is constrained to sales figures only, without insights into profits or margins. The dataset consists of three sheets: **Orders**, **Customers**, and **Products**. The accompanying **Entity Relationship Diagram** (ERD) illustrates a one-to-many relationship from both **Customers** and **Products** to **Orders**.

The analysis reveals that sales in America consistently rank the highest across all time frames, while Arabica coffee emerges as the top-performing product in terms of sales over time.

## **Summary of Insights**

### **Sales By Country**

United States - $35,639

Ireland - $6,697

United Kingdoms - $2,799

| Country | Sales |
| --- | --- |
| United States | 78.96% |
| Ireland | 14.84% |
| United Kingdom | 6.20% |

United States Contributes 78.96% of the Total sales.

### **Coffee Type Sales By Country**

| Country | Arabica | Excelsa | Liberica | Robusta |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| United States | 28.45% | 27.56% | 25.28% | 18.70% |
| Ireland | 20.31% | 22.90% | 32.35% | 24.44% |
| United Kingdom | 9.55% | 33.93% | 31.34% | 25.18% |

The above chart shows the Coffee Type Sales by Country contribution to individual countryâ€™s total sales and we can see that **Arabica Coffee in the United Kingdom has the least contribution**.

### Loyalty Card By Country

| Country | No | Yes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ireland | 46.74% | 53.26% |
| United Kingdom | 68.34% | 31.66% |
| United States | 53.80% | 46.20% |

We can clearly see that the **UK** has very less Loyalty card holders compared to the other two countries.

## **Assumptions and Caveats**

1. **Consumer Preferences:**
    
    The UK market may have a preference for other coffee types, such as Robusta, which is often used in blends and instant coffee due to its stronger, more bitter flavor profile. UK consumers may favor these options over the smoother and milder taste of Arabica.
    
2. **Market Competition:**
    
    The UK coffee market may have a strong presence of local or international brands that specialize in blends or non-Arabica varieties, creating stiff competition for pure Arabica coffee.
    
    ### **Loyalty Cards**
    
    1. **Limited Awareness of the Loyalty Program**
        
        If the loyalty program has not been effectively marketed in the UK, customers may be unaware of its existence or the benefits it offers. Poor communication or a lack of promotion through local channels could result in low participation.
        
    2. **Lack of Attractive Rewards**
        
        UK customers may not find the loyalty program appealing if the rewards are perceived as insignificant or irrelevant. For example, if the program offers discounts or perks that do not align with the customers' preferences or buying habits, they may lose interest in engaging with it.
